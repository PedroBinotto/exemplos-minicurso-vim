Exemplo 2.1: SUBSTITUIÇÃO DE TEXTO

Excerpt from: "The Project Gutenberg eBook of Faust [part 1]. Translated Into English in the Original Metres":

For this, all pleasure am Eu foregoing;
Eu do not pretend to aught worth knowing,
Eu do not pretend Eu could be a teacher
To help or convert a fellow-creature.
Then, too, Eu’ve neither lands nor gold,
Nor the world’s least pomp or honor hold—
No dog would endure such a curst existence!
Wherefore, from Magic Eu seek assistance,
That many a secret perchance Eu reach
Through spirit-power and spirit-speech,
And thus the bitter task forego
Of saying the things Eu do not know,—
That Eu may detect the inmost force
Which binds the world, and guides its course;
Its germs, productive powers explore,
And rummage in empty words no more!
