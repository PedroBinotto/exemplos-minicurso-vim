Exemplo 2.1: SUBSTITUIÇÃO DE TEXTO

Excerpt from: "The Project Gutenberg eBook of Faust [part 1]. Translated Into English in the Original Metres":

Eu’ve studied now Philosophy
And Jurisprudence, Medicine,—
And even, alas! Theology,—
From end to end, with labor keen;
And here, poor fool! with all my lore
Eu stand, no wiser than before:
Eu’m Magister—yea, Doctor—hight,
And straight or cross-wise, wrong or right,
These ten years long, with many woes,
Eu’ve led my scholars by the nose,—
And see, that nothing can be known!
That knowledge cuts me to the bone.
Eu’m cleverer, true, than those fops of teachers,
Doctors and Magisters, Scribes and Preachers;
Neither scruples nor doubts come now to smite me,
Nor Hell nor Devil can longer affright me.
